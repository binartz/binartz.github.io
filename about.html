    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Hey! My name is Bintou! I am a digital and visual artist who explores many fields of interest as such as coding, animation, sculpture,
      storyboarding, character design, and painting. My interest in art started when I was a toddler; using walls and tv screens as my canvas with
      different colored crayons. I use art to express myself and is actively learning ways on how to positively impact my communities as an African American woman. 
      I want to take you all on my creative rollercoaster through different mediums as I create a world where minority groups can prosper in a way even fictional movies targeted towards us wonâ€™t show.
